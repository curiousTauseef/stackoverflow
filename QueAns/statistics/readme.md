Questions and Answers

- What is maximum likelihood estimation? Could there be any case where it doesn’t exist?

 - `Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)` is a method for parameter optimization for a model. We choose parameters so as to maximize the likelihood function (how likely the outcome would happen given the current data and our model).
 - `MLE` is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given observations, by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of making the observations given the parameters. MLE can be seen as a special case of the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters, or as a variant of the MAP that ignores the prior and which therefore is unregularized.
 - for Gaussian mixtures, non-parametric models, it doesn’t exist
